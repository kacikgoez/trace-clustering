Backend:
	(Tong) Cluster: (and its testing)
		input: file, (array) sample set, algorithm names, support
		output: first show 3 pattern sets and after the user sets the 3 thresholds give the cluster
	(Kawa) Measurements: (and its testing)
		input: (2d array) sample set, (array) cluster
		output: recall, f1 measure, precision

Front-End:  
(Kawa)		Upload:
		input: file
		output: Redirect
()	Table:
		input: selection, attributes of labeling function, 4x thresholds,

() 	Measurements:
		output: recall, ..., FSPs, download XES files (Cluster)

Question: 
	UnitTesting - How should we approach it
	automate the computation of the thresholds
